# Assignment 3.3

## 1. Define matrix mymat by replicating the sequence 1:5 for 4 times 
# and transforming into a matrix, sum over rows and columns.


mymat <- matrix(rep(1:5,4), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
colnames(mymat) <- c("col1", "col2", "col3","col4")
rownames(mymat) <- c("row1", "row2","row3","row4")
mymat

# Add all Rows and Columns

rowSums(mymat)
colSums(mymat)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
